Welcome to my home on the internet. I mainly maintain this website for myself: from day to day, I stumble on so much useful information related to my craft that inevitably I also loose track of things encountered in the past. This website should serve as [my memory](/links/). If you found something here that helped you too, that's even better.

In addition, I write [blogposts](/) from time to time, though not as much as I'd like to. Feel free to go ahead and check them out. And don't forget to say hi on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/larslockefeer)!
