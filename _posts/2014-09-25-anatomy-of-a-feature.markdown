I love this quote by [Soroush Khanlou](http://khanlou.com/):

> At each layer of abstraction, we push down the complexity into another abstraction until the thing is so simple that it can be understood by glancing at it.

I believe it's what all programmers should strive for. Everything else will follow naturally.
