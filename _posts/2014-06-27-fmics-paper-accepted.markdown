While I started studying Computer Science out of an interest in programming, over the course of the years I became more and more interested in its more theoretical and formal aspects. For this reason, I decided to enroll in the Formal Methods for Software Verification program at the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](http://cs.vu.nl), which focuses on how to apply formal methods to verify the correctness of complex software systems.

For my [Master Thesis](/uploads/2014/MasterThesisLarsLockefeer.pdf), I specified an extension to the TCP Protocol in a formal language and verified that its behaviour is correct. After I graduated from university in 2013, my supervisors encouraged and helped me to create a paper out of this thesis, which we subsequently submitted for the 2014 edition of the conference on *Formal Methods for Industry Critical Systems*.

Earlier in June, we received confirmation that our submission was accepted and we have just submitted the final version to the conference. For reference, a manuscript of the paper can be found [here](uploads/2014/FMICSWithAppendix.pdf). The final, published version can be obtained from [Springer](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-10702-8_5).
